    "that defines the ReverieServer class. This class maintains and records all  \n",
    "states related to the simulation. The primary mode of interaction for those  \n",
    "running the simulation should be through the open_server function, which  \n",

      "Isabella Rodriguez: Hi Klaus, thanks for coming in today! I'm excited to discuss the Cafe Server position with you. Can you tell me a little bit about yourself and why you're interested in this role?\n",
      "Klaus Mueller: I'm really excited to be here, Isabella. As a sociology student at Oak Hill College, I've always been drawn to roles that allow me to interact with people and make a positive impact. When I heard about the Cafe Server position at Hobbs Cafe, I thought it would be a great opportunity to combine my passion for social justice with my love of food and drink. Plus, I've had the pleasure of eating at Hobbs Cafe before and have always enjoyed the atmosphere and service. I think my friendly and inquisitive nature would make me a great fit for this role.\n",
      "Isabella Rodriguez: That's wonderful, Klaus! It sounds like you'd be a great addition to our team. We're actually planning a special event for Valentine's Day, and I was wondering if you'd be interested in helping us prepare for it. We'll be having a party from 5pm to 7pm, and we need someone to help set up and serve food and drinks. Would you be available to work those hours on February 14th?\n",
      "Klaus Mueller: That sounds like a lot of fun! I'd be happy to help out with the Valentine's Day party. I'm free on February 14th and can definitely commit to working from 5pm to 7pm. What specific tasks do you need help with during that time?\n",
      "Isabella Rodriguez: Great, thank you Klaus! For the Valentine's Day party, we'll need to set up tables, chairs, and decorations beforehand. We'll also need to prepare and serve food and drinks during the party. Additionally, we'll have a photo booth and games, so we'll need someone to help facilitate those activities as well. Are you comfortable with all of these tasks?\n",
      "Klaus Mueller: I'm confident I can handle all of those tasks. I'm a quick learner and enjoy taking initiative. I'm also very organized, which will come in handy when setting up and facilitating the activities. I'm looking forward to contributing to making the Valentine's Day party a success!\n",
      "Isabella Rodriguez: That's fantastic, Klaus! I'm glad to hear you're willing to take on those responsibilities. Now, let's talk about your availability for regular shifts. Our cafe is open from 8am to 6pm, Monday to Sunday. Are you available to work flexible shifts within those hours?\n",
      "Klaus Mueller: I'm generally available to work most weekdays from 9am to 3pm, and weekends from 10am to 4pm. However, I do have a research paper deadline approaching on March 1st, so I might need to adjust my schedule slightly around that date. But overall, I'm pretty flexible and willing to work around the cafe's needs.\n",
      "Isabella Rodriguez: That's perfectly fine, Klaus. We understand that deadlines are important. Let's assume that you'll need to adjust your schedule around March 1st. In terms of regular shifts, we usually have a mix of morning and afternoon shifts. Would you prefer one over the other, or are you open to whatever shift is needed?\n",
      "Klaus Mueller: I'm actually more of a morning person, so I think I would prefer morning shifts. I find that I'm more energized and focused earlier in the day, which would help me provide better customer service. Plus, I'm already used to waking up early for my studies, so it wouldn't be too much of an adjustment.\n",
      "Isabella Rodriguez: That's great, Klaus! Morning shifts can be a bit busier than afternoons, but I think you'd do a great job handling the pace. Just to confirm, you're saying you're available to start at 8am every day, correct?\n",
      "Klaus Mueller: Yes, that's correct. I'm available to start at 8am every day. And just to clarify, what kind of training or orientation would I receive before starting my first shift?\n",
      "Isabella Rodriguez: Great, Klaus! Before we move forward, I want to give you a sense of what a typical day looks like for a Cafe Server at Hobbs Cafe.

      "Isabella Rodriguez: That's fantastic, Klaus! I'm glad to hear you're willing to take on those responsibilities. Now, let's talk about your availability for regular shifts. Our cafe is open from 8am to 6pm, Monday to Sunday. Are you available to work flexible shifts within those hours?\n",
      "Klaus Mueller: I'm generally available to work most weekdays from 9am to 3pm, and weekends from 10am to 4pm. However, I do have a research paper deadline approaching on March 1st, so I might need to adjust my schedule slightly around that date. But overall, I'm pretty flexible and willing to work around the cafe's needs.\n",
      "Isabella Rodriguez: That's perfectly fine, Klaus. We understand that deadlines are important. Let's assume that you'll need to adjust your schedule around March 1st. In terms of regular shifts, we usually have a mix of morning and afternoon shifts. Would you prefer one over the other, or are you open to whatever shift is needed?\n",
      "Klaus Mueller: I'm actually more of a morning person, so I think I would prefer morning shifts. I find that I'm more energized and focused earlier in the day, which would help me provide better customer service. Plus, I'm already used to waking up early for my studies, so it wouldn't be too much of an adjustment.\n",
      "Isabella Rodriguez: That's great, Klaus! Morning shifts can be a bit busier than afternoons, but I think you'd do a great job handling the pace. Just to confirm, you're saying you're available to start at 8am every day, correct?\n",
      "Klaus Mueller: Yes, that's correct. I'm available to start at 8am every day. And just to clarify, what kind of training or orientation would I receive before starting my first shift?\n",
      "Isabella Rodriguez: Great, Klaus! Before we move forward, I want to give you a sense of what a typical day looks like for a Cafe Server at Hobbs Cafe. You'll be responsible for greeting customers, taking orders, serving food and drinks, maintaining cleanliness of the cafe, and providing excellent customer service. We prioritize teamwork and communication among staff members, so you'll be working closely with the rest of the team to ensure everything runs smoothly. Are you ready to learn more about our cafe culture and procedures?\n",
      "Klaus Mueller: I'd love to learn more about the cafe culture and procedures. I'm a quick learner and enjoy adapting to new environments. Please go ahead and share more about how you envision the workflow and expectations for a Cafe Server.\n",
      "Isabella Rodriguez: So, let's walk through a typical day at Hobbs Cafe. We'll start with opening duties, where you'll help set up the cafe, including restocking supplies, wiping down surfaces, and getting the coffee machines ready. Then, you'll greet customers, take their orders, and serve them throughout the day. We also encourage our servers to engage with customers, build relationships, and provide recommendations. After lunch, you'll continue to serve customers, and towards the end of the day, you'll help clean up and close down the cafe. Does that sound like a good overview?\n",
